## Components

You can use flexdashboard to publish groups of related data visualizations as a dashboard. A flexdashboard can either be static (a standard web page) or dynamic (a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) interactive document). A wide variety of components can be included in flexdashboard layouts, including:

1. Interactive JavaScript data visualizations based on [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org).

2. R graphical output including base, lattice, and grid graphics.

3. Tabular data (with optional sorting, filtering, and paging).

4. Value boxes for highlighting important summary data.

5. Gauges for displaying values on a meter within a specified range.

6. Text annotations of various kinds.

See the [dashboard components](using.html#components) documentation for additional details on the use of each component type.

## Layout

### Single Column (Fill)

Dashboards are divided into columns and rows, with output components delineated using level 3 markdown headers (`###`). By default, dashboards are laid out within a single column, with charts  stacked vertically within a column and sized to fill available browser height. For example, this layout defines a single column with two charts that fills available browser space:

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-5">
<div id="singlecolumn"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('singlecolumn')</script>
</div>

<div class="col-md-7">
<div height="420px" width="100%">
<img class="holder" data-src="holder.js/100px210?size=28&amp;text=Chart 1">
<img class="holder" data-src="holder.js/100px210?size=28&amp;text=Chart 2">
</div>
</div>

</div>
